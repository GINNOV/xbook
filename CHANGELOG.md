# Changelog

All notable changes to **XBook Console** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Desktop links (tweets, videos, docs) open in the system browser instead of trapping navigation inside the webview.
- YouTube Google sign-in always opens in the system browser. A stored loopback redirect on a dead port (for example `:4010`) is rewritten to the live server origin.

### Changed

- YouTube Settings shows a connected / waiting / not-connected banner and waits for the browser OAuth callback without a reload.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Desktop production build no longer type-checks the Remotion trailer package (which has its own dependencies).

### Changed

- X and YouTube library page titles use the source logos instead of text-only headings.
- Library tables no longer show a category column (category remains in filters and the inspector).
- Library tables can be sorted by summary, author/channel, folder, posted date, and import date.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Dedicated **embedding model** and **embedding base URL** settings so chat (e.g. vLLM) and embeddings (e.g. Ollama `nomic-embed-text`) can run on different hosts.
- Dashboard **index health** panel: indexed vs missing embeddings, coverage bar, and **Sync embeddings** action.
- One-click **Process inbox** flow: import new items, enrich pending, then backfill embeddings.
- Advanced dashboard actions (sync-only, enrich pending, batch, force reprocess) behind a collapsible section.
- In-app docs coverage for the process-inbox and embedding-index workflows.
- Prisma fields / migrations: `llmEmbeddingModel`, `llmEmbeddingBaseUrl`.
- Signed desktop **auto-updater artifacts** (`createUpdaterArtifacts`), release packaging scripts, and a published `update.json` / `latest.json` manifest.

### Fixed

- **Sync embeddings** failed with HTTP 404 when the chat LLM server had no `/v1/embeddings` endpoint. Embedding generation now uses the embedding model (and optional embedding base URL) instead of the chat model URL.
- Clearer embedding error messages when the embeddings endpoint or model is misconfigured.
- Embedding sync query only selects bookmarks with a non-empty summary.
- Index health **missing** count no longer disagreed with sync progress: both use the same “needs embedding” rule, dashboard sync is **tab-scoped**, and progress shows `N of T · remaining` while live missing/indexed counters update during the run.
- **X sync burned API spend re-fetching immutable tweets**: delta sync no longer re-hydrates the whole library (was “0 new, refreshed 368”). With a baseline it only walks new global bookmarks and only advances `lastBookmarkId` from the global feed (folder tweets no longer corrupt the baseline).
- **X folder column empty / “No folder”**: folder membership is restored by walking folder **ID lists** (cheap) and `UPDATE`ing `folderId` on known tweets without re-fetching tweet bodies; only unknown tweets are hydrated.
- Auto-updater endpoint no longer 404s: dual endpoints (GitHub Releases `latest.json` + `main` branch `update.json`).

### Changed

- Docs → Configure your AI: added **Advanced: prompts & thinking** (system vs enrichment prompt, thinking off for batches, chat/embedding split, recommended defaults).
- LLM enrichment concurrency ceiling raised from **6 → 32** (settings, UI, and enrich route share `MAX_LLM_CONCURRENCY`).
- AI presets refreshed: **REMOTE** (example LAN vLLM host, `gemma-4-26b`, concurrency 32, split Ollama embeddings); local vLLM uses concurrency 4 and `EMPTY` API key; shorter preset labels. Removed redundant MLX preset (same shape as other OpenAI-compatible endpoints).
- Ollama and vLLM presets seed sensible embedding defaults (Ollama-compatible embeddings host + `nomic-embed-text` when unset).
- Embedding generation no longer falls back to the chat model id (chat models are usually unsupported by embeddings APIs).
- Settings → **Sync all missing embeddings** remains global; the dashboard button only indexes the active tab (X or YouTube).
- Desktop updater signing key rotated (0.3.0 never shipped signed updater payloads). Install 0.4.0 manually once; later updates use auto-update again.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Bulk reprocessing of already-enriched bookmarks.
- Desktop **window state** persistence (size/position) via Tauri.
- Database **backup / restore** controls in settings.
- Release packaging and auto-updater pointed at the standalone [GINNOV/xbook](https://github.com/GINNOV/xbook) repository.

### Changed

- Desktop standalone bundle skips unnecessary directories for smaller packages.
- Version aligned across `package.json`, Tauri config, and Cargo crate (`0.3.0`).

### Fixed

- Dependency and Dependabot security cleanups (including `undici` bumps).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- First tagged desktop-oriented release line for XBook Console.
- Versioning and release-automation notes for maintainers.

### Fixed

- Desktop startup reliability and packaging issues after Tauri restore.
- Unit / packaging test stability around the 0.2 release cut.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

Initial product foundation (pre-0.2 packaging polish).

### Added

- Local **SQLite** knowledge base for X (Twitter) and YouTube bookmarks.
- OAuth import / delta sync for X bookmarks and YouTube playlists/folders.
- Local or remote **LLM enrichment**: summaries, categories, tags.
- **Vector embeddings** field and semantic search over enriched content.
- Processing runs, events, and LLM request logging.
- Settings for LLM providers (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, OpenAI-compatible), concurrency, context/response limits, thinking mode, sounds, and monthly usage caps.
- Next.js App Router UI: dashboard, bookmarks lists, folders, processing monitor, settings, docs.
- Tauri desktop shell with bundled Node server and Prisma migrations.

## How to update this file

1. Under **[Unreleased]**, add entries as you merge work (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Security`).
2. When cutting a release, rename `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, bump versions in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and open a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` section at the top.
3. Prefer short, user-facing bullets over internal commit lists.
